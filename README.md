# ADS_PHASE5
# Stock Price Prediction README

This README provides instructions on how to run the code for stock price prediction using Jupyter Notebook. The code is designed to analyze historical stock market data, preprocess it, and build predictive models. Below are the steps to execute the code and the dependencies required.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)

You can install Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
Running the Code
Copy and execute the code from the document ADS_phase5 in Jupyter Notebook

Dataset: Download the "Microsoft Lifetime Stocks Dataset" from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasoonkottarathil/microsoft-lifetime-stocks-dataset) and save it in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file.

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the Jupyter Notebook and the dataset.
Run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

In your web browser, Jupyter Notebook should open. You'll see a list of files in your current directory.
Click on the Jupyter Notebook file with the code (e.g., "Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb").
Execute the Code: Inside the Jupyter Notebook, you can run the code cells one by one. Use the "Run" button or press Shift+Enter while in a cell to execute it. Follow the code comments and markdown cells for guidance.

Explore and Modify: Feel free to explore the code, modify it, or experiment with different features or models for stock price prediction.

File Description
ADS_phase5: The word document that contains the code for loading, preprocessing, and modeling the stock price data.

MSFT.csv: The dataset file (Microsoft Lifetime Stocks Dataset) used for analysis. Downloaded from Kaggle using the following link (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasoonkottarathil/microsoft-lifetime-stocks-dataset).
